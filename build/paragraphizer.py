#
# Paragraphizer attempts to reformat a single run-on paragraph into multiple shorter paragraphs,
# presumably split by topic. This is particularly useful for research paper abstracts, which are
# usually written in a sequential fashion (along the lines of 'Background / Question / Data /
# Methods / Results / Conclusion') but not always formatted in topic-separated paragraphs. A
# jargon-heavy run-on abstract can be near-impossible to skim.
#
# Paragraphizer does this by a call to the OA API; I have found that a simple 'rewrite this as'
# zero-shot prompt works well with davinci-instruct models (and is unreliable with smaller models or
# plain davinci). The main failure mode is that it will not copy the abstract exactly, and may
# reword or expand on parts, which is highly undesirable, and would mean that it cannot be used to
# automatically reformat abstracts. (And if you aren't going to use Paragraphizer automatically, why
# bother? It doesn't take long to add linebreaks by hand.) That failure mode can be removed by
# simply checking that after removing the new newlines, it equals the original input (ie. the *only*
# difference is the inserted newlines). The result can still be bad but it's probably at least
# better.

# Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms distill experience into parametric behavior
# policies or value functions via gradient updates. While effective, this approach has several
# disadvantages: (1) it is computationally expensive, (2) it can take many updates to integrate
# experiences into the parametric model, (3) experiences that are not fully integrated do not
# appropriately influence the agent's behavior, and (4) behavior is limited by the capacity of the
# model. In this paper we explore an alternative paradigm in which we train a network to map a
# dataset of past experiences to optimal behavior. Specifically, we augment an RL agent with a
# retrieval process (parameterized as a neural network) that has direct access to a dataset of
# experiences. This dataset can come from the agent's past experiences, expert demonstrations, or
# any other relevant source. The retrieval process is trained to retrieve information from the
# dataset that may be useful in the current context, to help the agent achieve its goal faster and
# more efficiently. We integrate our method into two different RL agents: an offline DQN agent and
# an online R2D2 agent. In offline multi-task problems, we show that the retrieval-augmented DQN
# agent avoids task interference and learns faster than the baseline DQN agent. On Atari, we show
# that retrieval-augmented R2D2 learns significantly faster than the baseline R2D2 agent and
# achieves higher scores. We run extensive ablations to measure the contributions of the components
# of our proposed method.

- <abstract>Previous theoretical results pertaining to meta-learning on sequences build on contrived assumptions and are somewhat convoluted. We introduce new information-theoretic tools that lead to an elegant and very general decomposition of error into 3 components: irreducible error, meta-learning error, and intra-task error. These tools unify analyses across many meta-learning challenges. To illustrate, we apply them to establish new results about in-context learning with transformers. Our theoretical results characterizes how error decays in both the number of training sequences and sequence lengths. Our results are very general; for example, they avoid contrived mixing time assumptions made by all prior results that establish decay of error with sequence length.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Scalable oversight protocols aim to enable humans to accurately supervise superhuman AI. In this paper we study debate, where two AI's compete to convince a judge; consultancy, where a single AI tries to convince a judge that asks questions; and compare to a baseline of direct question-answering, where the judge just answers outright without the AI. We use large language models (LLMs) as both AI agents and as stand-ins for human judges, taking the judge models to be weaker than agent models. We benchmark on a diverse range of asymmetries between judges and agents, extending previous work on a single extractive QA task with information asymmetry, to also include mathematics, coding, logic and multimodal reasoning asymmetries. We find that debate outperforms consultancy across all tasks when the consultant is randomly assigned to argue for the correct/incorrect answer. Comparing debate to direct question answering, the results depend on the type of task: in extractive QA tasks with information asymmetry debate outperforms direct question answering, but in other tasks without information asymmetry the results are mixed. Previous work assigned debaters/consultants an answer to argue for. When we allow them to instead choose which answer to argue for, we find judges are less frequently convinced by the wrong answer in debate than in consultancy. Further, we find that stronger debater models increase judge accuracy, though more modestly than in previous studies.</abstract> →

- <abstract>If an individual entity endures a fixed probability μ &lt;1 of disappearing (“dying”) in a given fixed time period, then, as time approaches infinity, the probability of death approaches certainty. One approach to avoid this fate is for individuals to copy themselves into different locations; if the copies each have an independent probability of dying, then the total risk is much reduced. However, to avoid the same ultimate fate, the entity must continue copying itself to continually reduce the risk of death. In this paper, we show that to get a non-zero probability of ultimate survival, it suffices that the number of copies grows logarithmically with time. Accounting for expected copy casualties, the required rate of copying is hence bounded.</abstract> →

We employ a progressively growing skip-connected encoder-generator structure and train it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a> loss for realistic output, a cycle consistency loss for maintaining same-domain translation identity, and a semantic consistency loss that encourages the network to keep the input semantic features in the output.

The result is a large, naturalistic, longitudinal dataset of infant-perspective and child-perspective videos. Transcription efforts are underway, with over 200,000 words of naturalistic dialogue already transcribed. Similarly, the dataset is searchable using a number of criteria (eg. age of participant, location, setting, objects present). The resulting dataset will be of broad use to psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762#google" title="‘Attention Is All You Need’, Vaswani et al 2017">Transformer</a> uses <em>𝒪(n<sup>2</sup>)</em> time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from <em>𝒪(n<sup>2</sup>)</em> to <em>𝒪(n)</em> in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the <strong>Linformer</strong>, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory-efficient and time-efficient.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Technologies to measure gaze direction and pupil reactivity have become efficient, cheap, and compact and are finding increasing use in many fields, including gaming, marketing, driver safety, military, and healthcare. Besides offering numerous useful applications, the rapidly expanding technology raises serious privacy concerns. Through the lens of advanced data analytics, gaze patterns can reveal much more information than a user wishes and expects to give away. Drawing from a broad range of scientific disciplines, this paper provides a structured overview of personal data that can be inferred from recorded eye activities. Our analysis of the literature shows that eye tracking data may implicitly contain information about a user’s biometric identity, gender, age, ethnicity, body weight, personality traits, drug consumption habits, emotional state, skills and abilities, fears, interests, and sexual preferences. Certain eye tracking measures may even reveal specific cognitive processes and can be used to diagnose various physical and mental health conditions. By portraying the richness and sensitivity of gaze data, this paper provides an important basis for consumer education, privacy impact assessments, and further research into the societal implications of eye tracking.</abstract> →

- <abstract>This paper reviews arguments for land value taxation (LVT) as a tool to stop urban sprawl, eliminate land speculation, reduce housing costs, and provide tax relief. It is found that LVT would increase, not lower land prices and would provide only a small incentive to building construction. LVT would not favorably affect the distribution of wealth, nor reduce housing costs. It could provide some residential tax relief, but less effectively than other methods such as a progressive property tax.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Most targeted anticancer therapies fail due to drug resistance evolution. Here we show that tumor evolution can be reproducibly redirected to engineer therapeutic opportunity, regardless of the exact ensemble of pre-existing genetic heterogeneity. We develop a selection gene drive system that is stably introduced into cancer cells and is composed of two genes, or switches, that couple an inducible fitness advantage with a shared fitness cost. Using stochastic models of evolutionary dynamics, we identify the design criteria for selection gene drives. We then build prototypes that harness the selective pressure of multiple approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors and employ therapeutic mechanisms as diverse as prodrug catalysis and immune activity induction. We show that selection gene drives can eradicate diverse forms of genetic resistance in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that model-informed switch engagement effectively targets pre-existing resistance in mouse models of solid tumors. These results establish selection gene drives as a powerful framework for evolution-guided anticancer therapy.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</abstract> →

- <abstract>This paper examines the relationship between sleep quality and academic performance in college students. Using actigraphy data and self-reported sleep logs from 150 participants over a semester, we analyzed sleep duration, efficiency, and timing in relation to GPA and test scores. Results indicate a complex interaction between sleep metrics and academic outcomes, with some counterintuitive findings. While overall sleep duration showed a weak positive correlation with GPA, sleep timing regularity emerged as a stronger predictor of academic success. However, the effects varied across different academic disciplines and assessment types. These findings highlight the need for nuanced approaches to sleep interventions in academic settings and call for further research into the multifaceted nature of sleep's impact on cognitive performance.</abstract> →

- <abstract>We present a novel machine learning algorithm for detecting anomalies in time series data. Our approach combines elements of deep learning and statistical process control to identify subtle deviations from expected patterns. The algorithm was tested on diverse datasets including financial market data, industrial sensor readings, and physiological measurements. Performance metrics show significant improvements over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. However, challenges remain in tuning the algorithm for specific domains and interpreting its decisions. We discuss potential applications in fields such as predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and health monitoring, as well as ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of such systems. Future work will focus on enhancing the algorithm's explainability and adapting it for real-time streaming data.</abstract> →

- <abstract>This study investigates the impact of social media use on political polarization. We conducted a large-scale survey of 10,000 participants across five countries, complemented by analysis of social media activity and network structures. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture of social media's role in shaping political attitudes. While echo chambers and filter bubbles were observed, their effects were moderated by individual differences in media literacy and personality traits. Contrary to popular belief, we found that exposure to diverse viewpoints on social media can sometimes reinforce pre-existing biases rather than reduce them. The relationship between social media use and political polarization appears to be bidirectional and context-dependent. These results have implications for platform design, media policy, and civic education initiatives aimed at promoting democratic discourse in the digital age.</abstract> →

- <abstract>In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computing for solving optimization problems in supply chain management. We developed a quantum algorithm that addresses the vehicle routing problem with time windows, a classic NP-hard problem in logistics. Using a quantum annealer with 2000 qubits, we compared our approach to state-of-the-art classical algorithms. Results show that the quantum approach can find near-optimal solutions for medium-sized instances faster than classical methods, but struggles with larger problem sizes due to current hardware limitations. We discuss the challenges of mapping real-world logistics problems onto quantum architectures and propose hybrid quantum-classical approaches as a promising direction. The paper concludes with a roadmap for scaling quantum optimization techniques to practical supply chain problems, considering both technological advances and algorithm design.</abstract> →

- <abstract>This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecological impacts of microplastics in marine ecosystems. We examine evidence from laboratory studies, field observations, and modeling efforts to assess the distribution, bioaccumulation, and effects of microplastics across trophic levels. While clear negative impacts have been demonstrated in controlled experiments, especially for filter-feeding organisms, translating these findings to ecosystem-level consequences remains challenging. Factors such as polymer type, size distribution, and environmental conditions significantly influence microplastic behavior and toxicity. We identify key knowledge gaps, including the long-term effects of chronic exposure, interactions with other pollutants, and potential evolutionary responses of marine organisms. The review also addresses methodological challenges in microplastic research and proposes standardized protocols for sampling and analysis. Finally, we discuss implications for marine conservation policies and suggest priorities for future research to better understand and mitigate the threats posed by microplastics to ocean health.</abstract> →

- <abstract>This study evaluates the impact of depression treatment on economic behavior in Karnataka, India. We cross-randomize pharmacotherapy and livelihoods assistance among 1,000 depressed adults and evaluate impacts on depression severity, socioeconomic outcomes, and several potential pathways. When combined, the interventions reduce depression severity, with benefits that persist after treatment concludes. Pharmacotherapy alone has a weaker effect that is only marginally significant and dissipates sooner. Depression treatment does not significantly increase earnings, consumption, or human capital investment in children.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Large language models can memorize and repeat their training data, causing privacy and copyright risks. To mitigate memorization, we introduce a subtle modification to the next-token training objective that we call the goldfish loss. During training, a randomly sampled subset of tokens are excluded from the loss computation. These dropped tokens are not memorized by the model, which prevents verbatim reproduction of a complete chain of tokens from the training set. We run extensive experiments training billion-scale Llama-2 models, both pre-trained and trained from scratch, and demonstrate reductions in extractable memorization with little to no impact on downstream benchmarks.</abstract> →

- <abstract>To enable building and testing models on long-document comprehension, we introduce QuALITY, a multiple-choice QA dataset with context passages in English that have an average length of about 5,000 tokens, much longer than typical current models can process. Unlike in prior work with passages, our questions are written and validated by contributors who have read the entire passage, rather than relying on summaries or excerpts. In addition, only half of the questions are answerable by annotators working under tight time constraints, indicating that skimming and simple search are not enough to consistently perform well. Our baseline models perform poorly on this task (55.4%) and lag behind human performance (93.5%).</abstract> →

- <abstract>We propose a novel neural network architecture, the normalized <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762#google">Transformer</a> (nGPT) with representation learning on the hypersphere. In nGPT, all vectors forming the embeddings, MLP, attention matrices and hidden states are unit norm normalized. The input stream of tokens travels on the surface of a hypersphere, with each layer contributing a displacement towards the target output predictions. These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks, whose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere. Experiments show that nGPT learns much faster, reducing the number of training steps required to achieve the same accuracy by a factor of 4 to 20, depending on the sequence length.</abstract> →

In this new version, we apply several known technical modifications to the Transformer architecture, such as interleaving local-global attentions (Beltagy et al 2020a) and group-query attention (Ainslie et al 2023).

- <abstract>Multi-query attention (MQA), which only uses a single key-value head, drastically speeds up decoder inference. However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Although domestic cats are among the most common companion animals, we still know very little about the details of the cat-human relationship. With a questionnaire, we asked 157 Hungarian cat owners about their pet’s behavior, cognitive abilities, and social interactions. We analyzed the responses with PCA resulting in 11 traits. The effect of cats’ and owners’ demographic variables on the main components was further analyzed with GLM. The results showed strong similarity to the surveys performed with companion dogs, but we also found features that were mainly cat-specific.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Few-shot learners aim to recognize new object classes based on a small number of labeled training examples. To prevent overfitting, state-of-the-art few-shot learners use meta-learning on convolutional-network features and perform classification using a nearest-neighbor classifier. This paper studies the accuracy of nearest-neighbor baselines without meta-learning. Surprisingly, we find simple feature transformations suffice to obtain competitive few-shot learning accuracies. For example, we find that a nearest-neighbor classifier used in combination with mean-subtraction and 𝓁<sub>2</sub>-normalization outperforms prior results in 3⁄5 settings on the miniImageNet dataset.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Instruct (or “chat”) tuned models have become the primary way in which most people interact with large language models. As opposed to “base” or “foundation” models, instruct-tuned models are optimized to respond to imperative statements.

Its largest version, Hermes 3 405B, achieves state of the art performance among open weight models on several public benchmarks.</abstract> →

- <abstract>It is well known that dogs are capable of following human verbal instructions. However, very little is known about the equivalent ability in cats. In this study, we used a switched stimuli task to examine whether cats rapidly form picture-word association, which is a fundamental ability for word learning. We presented cats with two meaningless picture-word combinations, in the habituation phase. Then, on half of the trials we switched the combination (switched condition), but the other half of the trials remained as before (non-switched condition). If cats rapidly form picture-word association, they were expected to look at the monitor for longer in the switched condition, reflecting detection of the change. We used human speech as stimuli in Exp.1, and mechanical sounds (electronic sounds) in Exp.2. Cats expressed detection of the switched combination in Exp.1, where human speech and objects were paired. However, in Exp.2 where non-social sounds and objects were paired, there was no statistical difference between switched and non-switched conditions, although there was a main effect of condition when the data from the two experiments were pooled. These results demonstrate that cats can rapidly form picture-word association. Further research should investigate whether domestication has played a role in this ability.</abstract> →

- <abstract>The decade from 2010 to 2020 saw remarkable improvements in automatic speech recognition. Many people now use speech recognition on a daily basis, for example to perform voice search queries, send text messages, and interact with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Siri by Apple. Before 2010 most people rarely used speech recognition. Given the remarkable changes in the state of speech recognition over the previous decade, what can we expect over the coming decade? I attempt to forecast the state of speech recognition research and applications by the year 2030. While the changes to general speech recognition accuracy will not be as dramatic as in the previous decade, I suggest we have an exciting decade of progress in speech technology ahead of us.</abstract> →

- <abstract>The advent of generative AI images has completely disrupted the art world. Distinguishing AI generated images from human art is a challenging problem whose impact is growing over time. A failure to address this problem allows bad actors to defraud individuals paying a premium for human art and companies whose stated policies forbid AI imagery. It is also critical for content owners to establish copyright, and for model trainers interested in curating training data in order to avoid potential model collapse. There are several different approaches to distinguishing human art from AI images, including classifiers trained by supervised learning, research tools targeting diffusion models, and identification by professional artists using their knowledge of artistic techniques. In this paper, we seek to understand how well these approaches can perform against today’s modern generative models in both benign and adversarial settings. We curate real human art across 7 styles, generate matching images from 5 generative models [DALL·E 3, Midjourney v6, SDXL, Firefly, Civitai], and apply 8 detectors (5 automated detectors and 3 different human groups including 180 crowdworkers, 4000+ professional artists, and 13 expert artists experienced at detecting AI). Both Hive and expert artists do very well, but make mistakes in different ways (Hive is weaker against adversarial perturbations while Expert artists produce higher false positives). We believe these weaknesses will remain as models continue to evolve, and use our data to demonstrate why a combined team of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness. →

- <abstract>The rise of algorithmic pricing raises concerns of algorithmic collusion. We conduct experiments with algorithmic pricing agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that (1) LLM-based agents are adept at pricing tasks, (2) LLM-based pricing agents autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers, and (3) variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions (‘prompts’) may increase collusion. Novel off-path analysis techniques uncover price-war concerns as contributing to these phenomena. Our results extend to auction settings. Our findings uncover unique challenges to any future regulation of LLM-based pricing agents, and black-box pricing agents more broadly.</abstract> →

- <abstract>We explore the question: “How much prior art knowledge is needed to create art?” To investigate this, we propose a text-to-image generation model trained without access to art-related content. We then introduce a simple yet effective method to learn an art adapter using only a few examples of selected artistic styles. Our experiments show that art generated using our method is perceived by users as comparable to art produced by models trained on large, art-rich datasets. Finally, through data attribution techniques, we illustrate how examples from both artistic and non-artistic datasets contributed to the creation of new artistic styles.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Intelligence and rationality both predict optimal decision making. However, whether cognitive rationality (CR) and general cognitive ability (CA) are identical or reflect fundamentally distinct processes is hotly debated. Here, we report a twin study aimed at distinguishing the cognitive mechanisms involved in CR and CA. CR and CA tests were administered to a large twin sample. Univariate analyses indicated that both CA and CR were strongly heritable. Multivariate modelling of CA scales and CR indicated that CR was accounted for by a latent g-factor, which itself was strongly heritable. We conclude that CR is not a distinct disposition from CA, but instead that the reflexive and reflective aspects of cognitive ability make making CR a robust and efficient test of general cognitive ability.</abstract> →

- <abstract>We study how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. We propose STORM, a writing system for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking. STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline. For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.</abstract> →

- <abstract>This paper uses wealth shocks from winning lottery prizes to examine the causal effect of financial resources on fertility. We employ extensive panels of administrative data encompassing over 0.4 million lottery winners in Taiwan and implement a triple-differences design. Our analyses reveal that a substantial lottery win can increase fertility, the implied wealth elasticity of which is around 0.06. Moreover, the primary channel through which fertility increases is by prompting first births among previously childless individuals. Finally, our analysis reveals that ~25% of the total fertility effect stems from increased marriage rates following a lottery win.</abstract> →

- <abstract>An expert with no inherent interest in an unknown binary state can exert effort to acquire a piece of falsifiable evidence informative of it. A designer can incentivize learning using a mechanism that provides state-dependent rewards within fixed bounds. We show that eliciting a single report maximizes information acquisition if the evidence is revealing or its content predictable. This conclusion fails when the evidence is sufficiently imprecise, the failure to find it is informative, and its contents could support either state. Our findings shed light on incentive design for consultation and forecasting by showing how learning dynamics qualitatively shape effort-maximizing contracts.</abstract> →

- <abstract>In the developed world, the diagnosis of mental illness is widespread among young adults. This paper estimates the long-term causal effects of being diagnosed during young adulthood for those at the margin of diagnosis. We follow all Swedish men born between 1971 and 1983 matched to administrative panel data on health, labor market, and family outcomes to estimate the impact of a mental illness diagnosis on subsequent outcomes. Exploiting the random assignment of 18-year-old men to doctors, we find that, for people at the margin, a mental illness diagnosis increases the future likelihood of internal death, hospital admittance, being sick from work, and unemployment while also lowering expected income and the propensity to be married or have children. We find that diagnosis increases the use of psychiatric medication in the 36 months right after diagnosis. A possible interpretation of our results is that the amount and type of treatment used for marginal diagnosis may be inadequate, or inappropriate.</abstract> →

- <abstract>World War II was arguably one of history’s largest shocks to the US economic and production system. In this paper, I argue that “managerial technology” played a key role in shaping US WWII production and its capacity to defeat some of the most advanced economies in the world. The large-scale diffusion of innovative management practices to US firms involved in war production acted as a technology that put them on a higher growth path for decades. Moreover, it made US managerial practices internationally distinctive and created the “American Way” of doing business—exported worldwide in the aftermath of the war.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Many existing evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) quickly become outdated due to the emergence of new models and training data. These benchmarks also fall short in assessing how LLM performance changes over time, as they consist of static questions without a temporal dimension. To address these limitations, we propose using future event prediction as a continuous evaluation method to assess LLMs' temporal generalization and forecasting abilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict "future" event outcomes. Our findings reveal that as pre-training data becomes outdated, LLM performance degrades over time. While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy, the performance degradation pattern persists, highlighting the need for continuous model updates.</abstract> →

- <abstract>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into clinical diagnostics has the potential to transform doctor–patient interactions. However, the readiness of these models for real-world clinical application remains inadequately tested. This paper introduces the Conversational Reasoning Assessment Framework for Testing in Medicine (CRAFT-MD) approach for evaluating clinical LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on structured medical examinations, CRAFT-MD focuses on natural dialogues, using simulated artificial intelligence agents to interact with LLMs in a controlled environment. We applied CRAFT-MD to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mistral and LLaMA-2-7b across 12 medical specialties. Our experiments revealed critical insights into the limitations of current LLMs in terms of clinical conversational reasoning, history-taking and diagnostic accuracy. These limitations also persisted when analyzing multimodal conversational and visual assessment capabilities of GPT-4V. We propose a comprehensive set of recommendations for future evaluations of clinical LLMs based on our empirical findings. These recommendations emphasize realistic doctor–patient conversations, comprehensive history-taking, open-ended questioning and using a combination of automated and expert evaluations. The introduction of CRAFT-MD marks an advancement in testing of clinical LLMs, aiming to ensure that these models augment medical practice effectively and ethically.</abstract> →

- <abstract>We show that motion with as few as three degrees of freedom (for instance, a particle moving in a three-dimensional potential) can be equivalent to a Turing machine, and so be capable of universal computation. Such systems possess a type of unpredictability qualitatively stronger than that which has been previously discussed in the study of low-dimensional chaos. Even if the initial conditions are known exactly, virtually any question about their long-term dynamics is undecidable.</abstract> →

- <abstract>We provide evidence that classic lottery anomalies like probability weighting and loss aversion  are not special phenomena of risk. They also arise (and often with equal strength) when subjects evaluate deterministic, positive monetary payments that have been disaggregated to resemble lotteries. Thus, we find, e.g., apparent probability weighting in settings without probabilities and loss aversion in settings without scope for loss. Across subjects, anomalies in these deterministic tasks strongly predicts the same anomalies in lotteries. These findings suggest that much of the behavior motivating our most important behavioral theories of risk derive from complexity-driven mistakes rather than true risk preferences.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Derived from diffusion models, MangaNinja specializes in the task of reference-guided line art colorization. We incorporate two thoughtful designs to ensure precise character detail transcription, including a patch shuffling module to facilitate correspondence learning between the reference color image and the target line art, and a point-driven control scheme to enable fine-grained color matching. Experiments on a self-collected benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our model over current solutions in terms of precise colorization. We further showcase the potential of the proposed interactive point control in handling challenging cases, cross-character colorization, multi-reference harmonization, beyond the reach of existing algorithms.</abstract> →

- <abstract>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is involved in a range of central and peripheral pathways related to appetitive behavior. Hence, this study explored the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on substance and behavioral addictions, including alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, psychostimulants, compulsive shopping, and sex drive/libido. Data were collected from various social platforms. Keywords related to GLP-1 RAs and substance/behavioral addiction were used to extract relevant comments. The study employed a mixed-methods approach to analyze online discussions posted from December 2019 to June 2023 and collected using a specialized web application. Reddit entries were the focus here due to limited data from other platforms, such as TikTok and YouTube. A total of 5859 threads and related comments were extracted from six subreddits, which included threads about GLP-1 RAs drugs and associated brand names. To obtain relevant posts, keywords related to potential substance use and compulsive behavior were selected. Further analysis involved two main steps: (1) manually coding posts based on users’ references to the potential impact of GLP-1 RAs on substance use and non-substance habits, excluding irrelevant or unclear comments; (2) performing a thematic analysis on the dataset of keywords, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. Second, a thematic analysis was performed on the keyword-related dataset, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. In total, 29.75% of alcohol-related; 22.22% of caffeine-related; and 23.08% of nicotine-related comments clearly stated a cessation of the intake of these substances following the start of GLP-1 RAs prescription. Conversely, mixed results were found for cannabis intake, and only limited, anecdotal data were made available for cocaine, entactogens, and dissociative drugs’ misuse. Regarding behavioral addictions, 21.35% of comments reported a compulsive shopping interruption, whilst the sexual drive/libido elements reportedly increased in several users. The current mixed-methods approach appeared to be a useful tool in gaining insight into complex topics such as the effects of GLP-1 RAs on substance and non-substance addiction-related disorders; some GLP-1 RA-related mental health benefits could also be inferred from here. Overall, it appeared that GLP-1 RAs may show the potential to target both substance craving and maladaptive/addictive behaviors, although further empirical research is needed.</abstract> →

In total, 29.75% of alcohol-related; 22.22% of caffeine-related; and 23.08% of nicotine-related comments clearly stated a cessation of the intake of these substances following the start of GLP-1 RAs prescription.
Conversely, mixed results were found for cannabis intake, and only limited, anecdotal data were made available for cocaine, entactogens, and dissociative drugs’ misuse.
Regarding behavioral addictions, 21.35% of comments reported a compulsive shopping interruption, whilst the sexual drive/libido elements reportedly increased in several users.
The current mixed-methods approach appeared to be a useful tool in gaining insight into complex topics such as the effects of GLP-1 RAs on substance and non-substance addiction-related disorders; some GLP-1 RA-related mental health benefits could also be inferred from here.
Overall, it appeared that GLP-1 RAs may show the potential to target both substance craving and maladaptive/addictive behaviors, although further empirical research is needed.
