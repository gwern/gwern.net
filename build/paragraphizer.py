# paragraphizer.py: reformat a single paragraph into multiple paragraphs using OpenAI API neural nets

# Usage: $ OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXX" echo [...] | python paragraphizer.py
#
# Paragraphizer attempts to reformat a single run-on paragraph into multiple shorter paragraphs,
# presumably split by topic. This is particularly useful for research paper abstracts, which are
# usually written in a sequential fashion (along the lines of 'Background / Question / Data /
# Methods / Results / Conclusion') but not always formatted in topic-separated paragraphs. A
# jargon-heavy run-on abstract can be near-impossible to skim.
#
# Paragraphizer does this by a call to the OA API; I have found that a simple 'rewrite this as'
# zero-shot prompt works well with davinci-instruct models (and is unreliable with smaller models or
# plain davinci). The main failure mode is that it will not copy the abstract exactly, and may
# reword or expand on parts, which is highly undesirable, and would mean that it cannot be used to
# automatically reformat abstracts. (And if you aren't going to use Paragraphizer automatically, why
# bother? It doesn't take long to add linebreaks by hand.) That failure mode can be removed by
# simply checking that after removing the new newlines, it equals the original input (ie. the *only*
# difference is the inserted newlines). The result can still be bad but it's probably at least
# better.

# Example:

# $ xclip -o
# Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms distill experience into parametric behavior
# policies or value functions via gradient updates. While effective, this approach has several
# disadvantages: (1) it is computationally expensive, (2) it can take many updates to integrate
# experiences into the parametric model, (3) experiences that are not fully integrated do not
# appropriately influence the agent's behavior, and (4) behavior is limited by the capacity of the
# model. In this paper we explore an alternative paradigm in which we train a network to map a
# dataset of past experiences to optimal behavior. Specifically, we augment an RL agent with a
# retrieval process (parameterized as a neural network) that has direct access to a dataset of
# experiences. This dataset can come from the agent's past experiences, expert demonstrations, or
# any other relevant source. The retrieval process is trained to retrieve information from the
# dataset that may be useful in the current context, to help the agent achieve its goal faster and
# more efficiently. We integrate our method into two different RL agents: an offline DQN agent and
# an online R2D2 agent. In offline multi-task problems, we show that the retrieval-augmented DQN
# agent avoids task interference and learns faster than the baseline DQN agent. On Atari, we show
# that retrieval-augmented R2D2 learns significantly faster than the baseline R2D2 agent and
# achieves higher scores. We run extensive ablations to measure the contributions of the components
# of our proposed method.

f"""Task: reformatting abstracts.

Summary: Add relevant HTML hyperlinks & formatting to text, and adds double-newlines to split abstracts into Markdown paragraphs (one topic per paragraph.)

Task description: Please process the following abstract (between the '<abstract>' and '</abstract>' tags), by adding double-newlines to split it into paragraphs (one topic per paragraph.) The order of topics should be: 1. background/introduction; 2. methods/data/approach; 3. results/benchmarks/outputs; 4. conclusion/discussion/implications; 5. supplementary information (eg. URLs, code, websites, datasets).

Additional formatting instructions: convert to American spelling & conventions. Do not add unnecessary italics; but italicize species names as appropriate. If a new term, concept, or system is introduced by this research paper, bold the first appearance using '<strong>NAME</strong>' formatting (and ONLY the first use), and bold only the most important new term. Please also add useful hyperlinks (such as Wikipedia articles) in HTML format to technical terminology or names (but do not hyperlink obvious familiar terms like "University" or "psychology"); do not duplicate links: include each link ONLY once; include only URLs you are sure of. Please include ONLY the resulting text with hyperlinks in your output, include ALL the original text, and include NO other conversation or comments.

Examples:

- Input: <abstract>Previous theoretical results pertaining to meta-learning on sequences build on contrived assumptions and are somewhat convoluted. We introduce new information-theoretic tools that lead to an elegant and very general decomposition of error into 3 components: irreducible error, meta-learning error, and intra-task error. These tools unify analyses across many meta-learning challenges. To illustrate, we apply them to establish new results about in-context learning with transformers. Our theoretical results characterizes how error decays in both the number of training sequences and sequence lengths. Our results are very general; for example, they avoid contrived mixing time assumptions made by all prior results that establish decay of error with sequence length.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>Scalable oversight protocols aim to enable humans to accurately supervise superhuman AI. In this paper we study debate, where two AI's compete to convince a judge; consultancy, where a single AI tries to convince a judge that asks questions; and compare to a baseline of direct question-answering, where the judge just answers outright without the AI. We use large language models (LLMs) as both AI agents and as stand-ins for human judges, taking the judge models to be weaker than agent models. We benchmark on a diverse range of asymmetries between judges and agents, extending previous work on a single extractive QA task with information asymmetry, to also include mathematics, coding, logic and multimodal reasoning asymmetries. We find that debate outperforms consultancy across all tasks when the consultant is randomly assigned to argue for the correct/incorrect answer. Comparing debate to direct question answering, the results depend on the type of task: in extractive QA tasks with information asymmetry debate outperforms direct question answering, but in other tasks without information asymmetry the results are mixed. Previous work assigned debaters/consultants an answer to argue for. When we allow them to instead choose which answer to argue for, we find judges are less frequently convinced by the wrong answer in debate than in consultancy. Further, we find that stronger debater models increase judge accuracy, though more modestly than in previous studies.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>If an individual entity endures a fixed probability μ &lt;1 of disappearing (“dying”) in a given fixed time period, then, as time approaches infinity, the probability of death approaches certainty. One approach to avoid this fate is for individuals to copy themselves into different locations; if the copies each have an independent probability of dying, then the total risk is much reduced. However, to avoid the same ultimate fate, the entity must continue copying itself to continually reduce the risk of death. In this paper, we show that to get a non-zero probability of ultimate survival, it suffices that the number of copies grows logarithmically with time. Accounting for expected copy casualties, the required rate of copying is hence bounded.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>We present a framework for translating unlabeled images from one domain into analog images in another domain. We employ a progressively growing skip-connected encoder-generator structure and train it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a> loss for realistic output, a cycle consistency loss for maintaining same-domain translation identity, and a semantic consistency loss that encourages the network to keep the input semantic features in the output.

- Input: <abstract>We introduce a new resource: the SAYCam corpus. Infants aged 6–32 months wore a head-mounted camera for ~2 hours per week, over the course of ~two and a half years. The result is a large, naturalistic, longitudinal dataset of infant-perspective and child-perspective videos. Transcription efforts are underway, with over 200,000 words of naturalistic dialogue already transcribed. Similarly, the dataset is searchable using a number of criteria (eg. age of participant, location, setting, objects present). The resulting dataset will be of broad use to psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762#google" title="‘Attention Is All You Need’, Vaswani et al 2017">Transformer</a> uses <em>𝒪(n<sup>2</sup>)</em> time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from <em>𝒪(n<sup>2</sup>)</em> to <em>𝒪(n)</em> in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the <strong>Linformer</strong>, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory-efficient and time-efficient.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>Technologies to measure gaze direction and pupil reactivity have become efficient, cheap, and compact and are finding increasing use in many fields, including gaming, marketing, driver safety, military, and healthcare. Besides offering numerous useful applications, the rapidly expanding technology raises serious privacy concerns. Through the lens of advanced data analytics, gaze patterns can reveal much more information than a user wishes and expects to give away. Drawing from a broad range of scientific disciplines, this paper provides a structured overview of personal data that can be inferred from recorded eye activities. Our analysis of the literature shows that eye tracking data may implicitly contain information about a user’s biometric identity, gender, age, ethnicity, body weight, personality traits, drug consumption habits, emotional state, skills and abilities, fears, interests, and sexual preferences. Certain eye tracking measures may even reveal specific cognitive processes and can be used to diagnose various physical and mental health conditions. By portraying the richness and sensitivity of gaze data, this paper provides an important basis for consumer education, privacy impact assessments, and further research into the societal implications of eye tracking.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>This paper describes a reduction from the halting problem of Turing machines to subtype checking in Java. It follows that subtype checking in Java is undecidable, which answers a question posed by Kennedy and Pierce in 2007.

It follows that subtype checking in Java is undecidable, which answers a question posed by Kennedy and Pierce in 2007. It also follows that Java’s type checker can recognize any recursive language, which improves a result of Gil and Levy from 2016.
The latter point is illustrated by a parser generator for fluent interfaces.

- Input: <abstract>This paper reviews arguments for land value taxation (LVT) as a tool to stop urban sprawl, eliminate land speculation, reduce housing costs, and provide tax relief. It is found that LVT would increase, not lower land prices and would provide only a small incentive to building construction. LVT would not favorably affect the distribution of wealth, nor reduce housing costs. It could provide some residential tax relief, but less effectively than other methods such as a progressive property tax.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>Most targeted anticancer therapies fail due to drug resistance evolution. Here we show that tumor evolution can be reproducibly redirected to engineer therapeutic opportunity, regardless of the exact ensemble of pre-existing genetic heterogeneity. We develop a selection gene drive system that is stably introduced into cancer cells and is composed of two genes, or switches, that couple an inducible fitness advantage with a shared fitness cost. Using stochastic models of evolutionary dynamics, we identify the design criteria for selection gene drives. We then build prototypes that harness the selective pressure of multiple approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors and employ therapeutic mechanisms as diverse as prodrug catalysis and immune activity induction. We show that selection gene drives can eradicate diverse forms of genetic resistance in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that model-informed switch engagement effectively targets pre-existing resistance in mouse models of solid tumors. These results establish selection gene drives as a powerful framework for evolution-guided anticancer therapy.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>In classical computation, a “write-only memory” (WOM) is little more than an oxymoron, and the addition of WOM to a (deterministic or probabilistic) classical computer brings no advantage. We prove that quantum computers that are augmented with WOM can solve problems that neither a classical computer with WOM nor a quantum computer without WOM can solve, when all other resource bounds are equal. We focus on realtime quantum finite automata, and examine the increase in their power effected by the addition of WOMs with different access modes and capacities. Some problems that are unsolvable by two-way probabilistic Turing machines using sub-logarithmic amounts of read/write memory are shown to be solvable by these enhanced automata.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>This paper examines the relationship between sleep quality and academic performance in college students. Using actigraphy data and self-reported sleep logs from 150 participants over a semester, we analyzed sleep duration, efficiency, and timing in relation to GPA and test scores. Results indicate a complex interaction between sleep metrics and academic outcomes, with some counterintuitive findings. While overall sleep duration showed a weak positive correlation with GPA, sleep timing regularity emerged as a stronger predictor of academic success. However, the effects varied across different academic disciplines and assessment types. These findings highlight the need for nuanced approaches to sleep interventions in academic settings and call for further research into the multifaceted nature of sleep's impact on cognitive performance.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>We present a novel machine learning algorithm for detecting anomalies in time series data. Our approach combines elements of deep learning and statistical process control to identify subtle deviations from expected patterns. The algorithm was tested on diverse datasets including financial market data, industrial sensor readings, and physiological measurements. Performance metrics show significant improvements over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. However, challenges remain in tuning the algorithm for specific domains and interpreting its decisions. We discuss potential applications in fields such as predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and health monitoring, as well as ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of such systems. Future work will focus on enhancing the algorithm's explainability and adapting it for real-time streaming data.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>This study investigates the impact of social media use on political polarization. We conducted a large-scale survey of 10,000 participants across five countries, complemented by analysis of social media activity and network structures. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture of social media's role in shaping political attitudes. While echo chambers and filter bubbles were observed, their effects were moderated by individual differences in media literacy and personality traits. Contrary to popular belief, we found that exposure to diverse viewpoints on social media can sometimes reinforce pre-existing biases rather than reduce them. The relationship between social media use and political polarization appears to be bidirectional and context-dependent. These results have implications for platform design, media policy, and civic education initiatives aimed at promoting democratic discourse in the digital age.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computing for solving optimization problems in supply chain management. We developed a quantum algorithm that addresses the vehicle routing problem with time windows, a classic NP-hard problem in logistics. Using a quantum annealer with 2000 qubits, we compared our approach to state-of-the-art classical algorithms. Results show that the quantum approach can find near-optimal solutions for medium-sized instances faster than classical methods, but struggles with larger problem sizes due to current hardware limitations. We discuss the challenges of mapping real-world logistics problems onto quantum architectures and propose hybrid quantum-classical approaches as a promising direction. The paper concludes with a roadmap for scaling quantum optimization techniques to practical supply chain problems, considering both technological advances and algorithm design.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>This review synthesizes current knowledge on the ecological impacts of microplastics in marine ecosystems. We examine evidence from laboratory studies, field observations, and modeling efforts to assess the distribution, bioaccumulation, and effects of microplastics across trophic levels. While clear negative impacts have been demonstrated in controlled experiments, especially for filter-feeding organisms, translating these findings to ecosystem-level consequences remains challenging. Factors such as polymer type, size distribution, and environmental conditions significantly influence microplastic behavior and toxicity. We identify key knowledge gaps, including the long-term effects of chronic exposure, interactions with other pollutants, and potential evolutionary responses of marine organisms. The review also addresses methodological challenges in microplastic research and proposes standardized protocols for sampling and analysis. Finally, we discuss implications for marine conservation policies and suggest priorities for future research to better understand and mitigate the threats posed by microplastics to ocean health.</abstract> →

- Input: <abstract>This study evaluates the impact of depression treatment on economic behavior in Karnataka, India. We cross-randomize pharmacotherapy and livelihoods assistance among 1,000 depressed adults and evaluate impacts on depression severity, socioeconomic outcomes, and several potential pathways. When combined, the interventions reduce depression severity, with benefits that persist after treatment concludes. Pharmacotherapy alone has a weaker effect that is only marginally significant and dissipates sooner. Depression treatment does not significantly increase earnings, consumption, or human capital investment in children.</abstract> →
